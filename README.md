# Getting support

# General Application Stack

ORCID Source is set of web apps and libraries built in [Java](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29) with [Spring Web MVC](http://www.springsource.org/) and persistence provided by [Postgres Database](http://www.postgresql.org/).  

Frontend Technologies (brief version):
On the client side we utilize [HTML](http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp), [AJAX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)), [JQuery](http://jquery.com/) and [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/).  Server side we use [FreeMarker](http://freemarker.sourceforge.net/) for view rendering.

Backend Technologies (brief version):
[Spring Web MVC](http://www.springsource.org/) is our web framework. For security we use [Spring Security](http://www.springsource.org/). Our restful services are built with [Jersey](http://jersey.java.net/) and [JAXB](http://jaxb.java.net/). Finally we use [JPA](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/tech/persistence-jsp-140049.html)/[Hibernate](http://www.hibernate.org/) to persist models to a [Postgres Database](http://www.postgresql.org/) database.  

The above is just a brief introduction. Best way to see everything used is to dig into the code, but baring that please browse our [PROJECTS](https://github.com/ORCID/ORCID-Source/blob/master/PROJECTS.md) page.

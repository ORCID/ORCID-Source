WHAT IS ORCID?

Launched in October 2013, the ORCID Registry contains  unique identifiers 
(ORCID iDs) for researchers and scholars. Many publishers and granting agencies 
have started to ask for ORCID iDs with submissions to better link researchers with 
their research activities. ORCID iD holders control what is in their Records and 
who can see this information. Learn more about ORCID at ${baseUri}. 

Read ORCID's Privacy Policy at  ${baseUri}/privacy-policy.
Get help or ask questions by emailing support@orcid.org or visiting

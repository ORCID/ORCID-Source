Dear ${emailName},

You have requested that your ORCID Account associated with ORCID ID 
${baseUri}/${orcid} be deactivated. Please click on the following link 
to complete the deactivation process:

${baseUri}${deactivateUrlEndpoint}

Once an account is closed, you will not be able to create a new one using the email 
address associated with this closed account. So as not to assign the same 
identifier to another person, ORCID will maintain in a private data file your 
ORCID ID, name, and email address; all other data in your record will be removed.
You may contact ORCID if you later wish to re-claim your identifier and reactivate 
your account. 

If you did not request account deactivation, please contact the ORCID Help Desk at 
support@orcid.org. 

Kind Regards,
The ORCID Team

You have received this email as a service announcement related to your 
ORCID Account.

Dear ${emailName},

${creatorName} created an ORCID Account for you. 
This account provides you with a unique research identifier (an ORCID iD) that you 
can use in your publications and grants, and a place (an ORCID Record) to list 
information about your professional research activities.

WAHT DO YOU NEED TO DO?

Within the next 10 days, please review the information that ${creatorName} entered 
as a courtesy on your behalf. Once you have logged in the first time, your account 
will become active, and you will have complete control over the privacy of your 
record and the information it contains. To review your record and make changes, 
click your unique link below, or copy and paste it into your browser:

WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DO NOTHING?

If you take no action, your account will become active after the 10-day period. When 
your account becomes active, any information ${creatorName} may have marked as 
"viewable by all" will be viewable in the ORCID Registry and freely available to 
the public.

WHAT IS ORCID?

Launched in October 2013, the ORCID Registry contains unique identifiers (ORCID iDs) 
for researchers and scholars. Many publishers and granting agencies have started to 
ask for ORCID iDs with submissions to better link researchers with their research 
activities. ORCID iD holders control what is in the Records and who can see this 
information. Learn more about ORCID at ${baseUri}.

Read ORCID's Privacy Policy at ${baseUri}/privacy-policy.
